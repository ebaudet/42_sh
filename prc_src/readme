hi people,

i think we have a problem with the execution of the tree,
  we wanted to traverse the entire list and add it to the stack,
  then on the way back, using all the returns we execute the tail end of 
  every recursion in which we place the execve. sounds good right.
  
  the problem im having is that i can't seem to wrap my head around the pipes that are to be created for
  and what happens with the forks int he tree,
  if we have a pipe. we need to fork. the problem is that on the stack we have both
  direcitons saved seperatly

  we can avoid this problem by:
  doing a fork on the way into the stack
  never go deeper than than a pipe into the tree and execute the commands in the normal order while destacking

  This is what i would prefer
  execute the commands like normal using the order reght , left  top.
