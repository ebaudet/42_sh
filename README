{
	Makefile
	README: is the file that we give all informations on this for the project.
	auteur: Ty for check your login
	includes: all headers for the project
	libft: I really have to draw a picture ?? xd
	src_int: all sources for manage interface's 42_sh
	src_proc: all sources for process's 42_sh (lexeur, parseur and executable)
}
